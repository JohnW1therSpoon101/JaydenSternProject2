Backupprojectname: DrumSequencer

Goal: I want to make an interactive drum sequencer that is similar to FL Studio 
- the goal is for users to easily be able to make their own drum sequence that can be exported/download to their device.

ImprovementEdits: 
NEWFEATURES => 
- Include time signatures: 4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 2/2, 2/8, 3/2, 3/8, 4/2, 4/8, 5/4, 4/8, 7/4, 7/8, 9/4, 9/8, 11/4, 11/8
- give the user options to increase or decrease the length of the drumgrid (in bar length) 
Mixer: 
- add panning slider option
Mixrack : 
- below the mixer stuff for each sound, I want there to be a Ableton inspired mixer rack
- visualizer that shows volume levels
- Tracks should be verticle
