Backupprojectname: DrumSequencer

Goal: I want to make an interactive drum sequencer that is similar to FL Studio 
- the goal is for users to easily be able to make their own drum sequence that can be exported/download to their device.

Context: 
- I want to design various drum sounds using javascript

DrumSoundsList = Kick, Clap, Snare, HiHat, OpenHat, Crash
- the website will use premade sounds with javascript, but users will have the option to use their own audiofile drum sounds. 

Drumgrid => 
The drum grid should look like something similar to FL Studio's drum machine. 
Drumgrid options ==
- timesignature = user picks between various time signures. grid changes based off of this input 
- add drumsound = this option is for users if they want to add additional sounds to the drum machine. 


mixer => 
- there will be a mixer at the bottom below the drum machine. 
- the mixer will display all the drum tracks on the drum machinej
- Mixer features: 
- - adjust volume 
- - add reverb
- - add delay
- - add distortion 

- This is all i got so far.
