Problem: 
- When starting out, it is uncommon for music producers to have a sound library already. It is hard to get a reliable library of sounds without having to pay for it. 
Solution: 
- I want to make a website that essentially builds a sample library based on user input. Includes features below. 
- Link to Audio conversion
- AI Splitting
- Audio Extracting
- File orgazation 
- Key/Tempo determinant
- Gives you the key/bpm of the song you download
Plan: 
Layout => [

Home.html: 
websitetxt = "insertalink"

user will input a social media link (youtube, youtube shorts, instagram, instagram shorts, tiktok) 

- There will be an output log telling the user what's going on. The user will be made aware of everything that is working and everything that's not. 
- - EX: Ananlyzing link
- - EX: Linktype = (either youtube, instagram, tiktok) 
- - EX: Starting download using Method(#)
- - EX: Starting AI Splitter 
- - EX: Progress log 
- - EX: Packaging.. prepping for departure.
- - EX: Process complete !

Backend =>
I will be implementing my own python projets that I have been working on to help me with this project. 
Haven't decided if I will be attempting to build this with just javascript or both java and python.
