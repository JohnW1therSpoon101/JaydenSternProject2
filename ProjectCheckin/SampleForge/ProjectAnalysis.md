# üéµ Project Analysis: AI-Powered Sample Library Builder

Note: This was built using AI, but the contents are still my original ideas

## Project Title
**SampleForge: Intelligent Sound Library Builder**

---

## Project Description
**SampleForge** is a web-based platform designed to help emerging music producers automatically generate high-quality sample libraries from existing songs, videos, and social media content. 

By integrating powerful Python-based AI tools, the system converts a simple media link (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc.) into a curated set of organized, labeled, and tempo/key-identified samples ready for music production.  

This project aims to remove the entry barriers for producers who lack access to premium sound libraries and want to build their own unique sonic toolkit.

---

## Objectives and Scope

### üéØ Objectives
- Allow users to input a media link and generate usable samples in one click.  
- Automate the conversion, separation, and analysis process using AI tools.  
- Deliver clear, real-time progress logs so users understand each stage of the process.  
- Provide producers with an organized, production-ready library categorized by key, tempo, and instrument type.  

### üß© Scope
**In-Scope Features**
- Frontend web interface with live logging output  
- Audio extraction via link (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)  
- AI-based stem separation (vocals, drums, bass, other)  
- Automatic key and tempo detection  
- Organized folder export (categorized samples)  
- File download or packaging (ZIP export)

**Out-of-Scope**
- Manual sample editing or effects processing  
- Cloud storage or user account management  
- Commercial licensing or publishing functionality

## System Requirements

### ‚öôÔ∏è Frontend
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Purpose:** Collect link input, display progress logs, and manage user interaction.  
- **Core UI Flow:**
  - User inputs a social media or video link  
  - System displays real-time log updates such as:
    - ‚ÄúAnalyzing Link‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúDownloading Audio‚Ä¶‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúRunning AI Splitter‚Ä¶‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúExtracting Key/BPM‚Ä¶‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúPackaging Files‚Ä¶ Process Complete!‚Äù

### üß† Python Backend
**Primary Libraries**
| Library | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `yt-dlp` | Download and convert video/audio from YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram links |
| `demucs` | AI-based stem separation (vocals, bass, drums, others) |
| `essentia` | Key and tempo (BPM) detection |
| `librosa` | Audio analysis and visualization support |

**Framework:** FastAPI (to connect backend logic to frontend via API routes)  

---

## Constraints and Limitations
- **Compute Intensity:** AI stem separation and Essentia analysis require significant CPU/GPU resources.  
- **File Size:** Some video/audio links may exceed the upload/download limits for online hosting.  
- **Network Dependency:** Reliable internet connection needed for downloading external media.  
- **Licensing:** Users must ensure they have rights to use extracted content for sampling.  
- **Browser Compatibility:** Optimized for Chrome/Firefox; minor limitations on mobile browsers.

## Use Cases

### üéß Use Case 1 ‚Äî Building a Sample Library from YouTube
1. User enters a YouTube link of a favorite song.  
2. Backend downloads and extracts the audio.  
3. Demucs splits the track into stems.  
4. Essentia determines the key and tempo.  
5. The final folder is organized by key, BPM, and stem type, then zipped for download.  

### ü•Å Use Case 2 ‚Äî Extracting Drum Loops from TikTok Videos
1. User pastes a TikTok link.  
2. System extracts the short clip‚Äôs audio.  
3. Demucs isolates the percussion track.  
4. The drum loop is labeled with tempo and stored for immediate use in a DAW.  

### üé§ Use Case 3 ‚Äî Organizing Samples by Key/BPM
1. User uploads multiple downloaded stems.  
2. The app automatically tags and organizes them by musical key and BPM.  
3. Producers can quickly locate compatible samples for mixing and layering.
